<p>There are many excellent resources for learning <em>APA Style.</em> This chapter is not one of them. Rather, the intent of this chapter is to locate APA Style within health services psychology. In-so-doing, we hope to convey why it is valued and how adherence to the guidelines presented in the style manual can facilitate an effective and efficient transmission of ideas, information, and scientific findings. Simultaneously, we critically examine APA Style and question whether and how unquestioned allegiance to it may contribute to exclusion and oppression. While we do not <em>teach</em> APA style, we review the journal article reporting standards (JARS) by comparing the recommendations to a recently published article. We also provide an overview of the sometimes surprising topics that are covered in the Style Manual.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> The Culture of APA Style<a href="APAstyle.html#the-culture-of-apa-style" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The <em>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</em> has grown from its 7-page writers guide in the Psychological Bulletin (1929) to 427 in the 7th Edition <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-american_psychological_association_publication_2020" role="doc-biblioref">American Psychological Association, 2020</a>)</span>. Many who use the Style Manual are looking up guidelines for formatting parts of a paper that requires APA style, locating examples of resources to learn how to provide accurate citations, or consulting the journal article reporting standards (JARS) to learn what information is required in an empirical manuscript. Madigan et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> has suggested that within the individual who seeks to master APA Style and across the near-century that of Style Manual’s existence, the Style Manual has served an epistemological function. That is, through learning and practicing the guidelines, it has instilled attitudes and values, many of which are unarticulated and operate outside of our explicit awareness.</p>
<div id="apa-style-as-epistemology" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> APA Style as Epistemology<a href="APAstyle.html#apa-style-as-epistemology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Madigan <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> and colleagues compared APA style to that of other disciplines (e.g., history, literary criticism) and identified characteristics that uniquely define our writing. First, we use a story schema that consists of a prescribed introduction, method, results, and discussion. On the face of it, this seems straightforward – even linear. However research is messy and this messiness may not be reflected well (or at all) in the final paper. Within this story arc, readers and reviewers who are familiar with APA Style can expect to see a (a) review of past empirical studies, (b) collection and analysis of new data, and (c) connections between conclusions and psychological theory.</p>
<p>A second characteristic is the depersonalized language of disagreement that focuses on the method, analyses, and conclusions and not on the investigators as individuals <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">Madigan et al., 1995</a>)</span>. An example might be a statement like, “The relatively small sample likely contributed to Type I error.” Madigan and colleagues suggested that a goal of psychological science is a collaborative, cumulative endeavor based on research data that avoids animosity and confrontation and that the culture of APA style facilitates this conveyance. Related to this is the use of <em>hedged</em> conclusions. Hedged words like “tend,” “suggest,” and “may” are abundant in our writing. Further, we almost always claim that “more research is needed” before we can assert firm conclusions.</p>
<p>APA Style involves other people <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">Madigan et al., 1995</a>)</span>. Our papers are more likely to have multiple authors (than single authors). In fact, the 7th Edition instructs writers to list, by name, up to 20 authors in a reference list entry (when there are 21 or more, an elipses follows the first 19 and then lists the last author). This is an increase from prior editions and serves something of <em>permission</em> to extend authorship to those who contributed to the project.</p>
<p>Relatedly, our introduction and discussion sections include abundant citations that locate the research within a proximal body of literature. Rather than footnotes or endnotes, we use in-text references that include the last names of authors; this provides immediate information about the “who” of the research.</p>
<p>Madigan <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> and colleagues also documented distinct writing conventions that define the culture of our writing. For example, we tend to use headings and subheadings rather than narrative transitions; we are more likely to paraphrase than use direct quotes; and we use self-effacing and low-profile language that “does not call attention to itself.” These approaches maintain the focus on the topic of the paper and not the personhood of the author.</p>

<div id="apa-style-whiteness-and-patriarchy" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> APA Style, Whiteness, and Patriarchy<a href="APAstyle.html#apa-style-whiteness-and-patriarchy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Nearly a decade after Madigan et al.’s paper <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>, Thompson <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> examined APA style (i.e., the 5th edition) through the lens of critical race feminism and Whiteness Theory and argued that the expectations regarding clarity, precision, appropriateness, sensitivity, and objectivity likely contribute to the academy’s investments in Whiteness and patriarchy. Thompson’s analysis of <em>power and property investments</em> was organized into five themes that continue to be relevant for the 7th Edition.</p>
<p>The first theme is <em>property rights.</em> Predominantly White institutions (PWIs) have treated refereed scholarship as intellectual property, demarcated with a certain, privileged status. That is, <em>individuals</em> “own knowledge.” Thompson <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> cited evidence for this in the conventions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using last names as a shorthand reference for work (e.g., “Thompson’s [1995] ctitique of APA style”).</li>
<li>Citing one’s own work (e.g., “Bikos [2021] has argued…) rather than writing, “When I previously claimed…”</li>
<li>Using <em>et al.</em> for in-text citations when articles have three or more authors.</li>
<li>Ordering authorship on the basis of relative contribution and not professional position, power, or hierarchy (see section 1.22 in the 7th Edition). Thompson <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> also suggested that power dynamics (especially around race and gender) likely interferes with adherence to this principle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thompson’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> concern about the proprietariness of knowledge for <em>individuals</em> is that it provides no recognition for the <em>communities</em> from where the the knowledge was gathered. After all, where is stylistic guidance for citing community or institutional knowledge? For example, data can be obtained from and about the Black Church, but there is no guidance from the Style Manual on how to cite such knowledge. There is only guidance on citing others who have also written about it.</p>
<p>A second theme is <em>precedent and pedigree</em>. Our disciplinary commitment to the notion that knowledge is cumulative is reflected in voluminous citations of relevant earlier works. These include citations of the gurus, citations of statements that may seem obvious, and self-citations. Including these citations in the introductory sections of a research paper locates the proposed study within a body of knowledge and provides the requisite justification for its inclusion within the lineage of the research topic. This practice disadvantages novel ideas and excludes ideas and projects that would challenge existing power structures.</p>
<p><em>Proceduralism</em>, the third theme, refers to the constriction of communication via the standardized format and style <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">Thompson, 2004</a>)</span>. Regarding format, Thompson suggested that the Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion sections may be insufficient to capture the lived experiences of marginalized and oppressed groups. Regarding stylistic conventions, the Style Manual’s prescriptions for <em>elegant</em> writing and <em>unambiguous clarity</em> may not work for all groups, especially when information does not fit well into clean categories. The standardization of the <em>et al.</em> convention contributes to both gender- and color-blindness. On one hand, it is “fair.” On the other hand, the use of the first author’s surname obscures their identity and the identities of coauthors. Finally, APA Style discourages footnotes. We agree with Thompson’s claim that the most juicy arguments are always in the footnotes.</p>
<p>Following professional <em>protocol</em> means avoiding extremes and blending in. In this fourth theme, Thompson <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> notes that when one adheres to the protocol, they signal a recognition of the prevailing relations of power, authority, and legitimacy. The 7th Edition expanded what was previously a recommendation to avoid using insensitive and pejorative language, to an entire chapter on bias-free language. We agree with Thompson’s pre-7th Edition clasim – that such recommendations are admirable, but they do not address unequal power relations. Further, distinctions between what is insensitive and pejorative may be undetectable to those who hold privilege.</p>
<p>The fifth theme was the notion of a <em>gentleman’s agreement</em>; that is, a “language that conveys professionalism and formality” where “differences should be presented in a professional and noncombative manner” (7th Edition, section 4.7). Thompson <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> is concerned that while this is offered with the hope of pluralism and the creation of safe spaces, it causes controversies to be ignored or dismissed and may bolster complicity in racism.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> The JARS: The Core of APA Style<a href="APAstyle.html#the-jars-the-core-of-apa-style" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The JARS [Journal Article Reporting Standards; <span class="citation">Appelbaum et al. (<a href="#ref-appelbaum_journal_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>] were born out of a concern for transparency in psychological science. When researchers present their work using these comprehensive, uniform reporting standards, it makes it easier for readers and reviewers to work their way through individual papers, compare research, and use the results in meta-analyses <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-american_psychological_association_publication_2020" role="doc-biblioref">American Psychological Association, 2020</a>)</span>. Thus, the JARS provides an interconnected set of tables that list information that should be reported in prescribed sections of empirical manuscripts. The JARS does not specify in what order that the information should be presented – just that it should be available to the reader at the time they need it, and written such that does not interfere with the readability of the paper.</p>
<p>The JARS were first introduced in a 2008 feature in the American Psychologist <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-noauthor_reporting_2008" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Reporting Standards for Research in Psychology,”</span> 2008</a>)</span> and were included in the 6th Edition of the Style Manual. An updated JARS, published in 2018, expanded the types of quantitative research (JARS-Quant) as well as introduced tables for qualitative (JARS-Qual)and mixed methods studies (JARS-Mixed). Chapter 3 of the 7th Edition is devoted to the JARS. It contains numerous tables, definitions, explanations, and a flowchart.</p>
<p>Curiously, the second chapter of the 7th Edition provides another overview of each section of an APA Style manuscript. The information provided in the second chapter has a high degree of overlap and consistency with the JARS but focuses more on formatting conventions. We encourage authors to consult both.</p>
<p>A third set of guidelines for authors are found in individual journals. These guidelines may have inconsistencies with APA Style. When submitting to a specific journal, it is that journal’s guidelines that likely take precedent.</p>
<p>Given that the JARS and Chapter 2 recommendations, should be directly consulted when drafting an APA Style paper, we will not repeat them here. We thought, however, that it might be a useful exercise to review a recently published article, mapping if and where each of the JARS elements are included. We have chosen Yu-Te Huang and Randolph C. H. Chan’s (2022), “Effects of Sexual Orientation Concealment on Well-Being Among Sexual Minorities: How and When Does Concealment Hurt?” published in the <em>Journal of Counseling Psychology.</em> We strongly encourage you to work along with us by accessing a copy of the JARS either in the 7th Edition or <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/quantitative">online</a> and identifying (by highlighting) the elements in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35696152/">Huang and Chan’s paper</a></p>
<p>Utilization of the JARS should begin with its <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/jars-quant-decision-flowchart.pdf">flowchart</a>. Huang and Chan’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-huang_effects_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> research is quantitative in nature. The flowchart indicates that all quantitative studies should start with JARS-Quant Table 1. Because the study did not involve an experimental manipulation, the write-up should also adhere to JARS-Quant Table 3. In the table below, we paraphrase the JARS instructions, provide a quick summary of if-and-how Huang and Chang addressed it, and then provide a “+”, “-”, or “+/-” designation to indicate if it was present, absent, or partially addressed.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> What the Style Manual <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-american_psychological_association_publication_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> Has to Say About…<a href="APAstyle.html#what-the-style-manual--american_psychological_association_publication_2020-has-to-say-about" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>It can be surprising to learn that the Style Manual addresses issues beyond the order, content, and conventions of a manuscript. With explicit reference to the APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct [APA Ethics Code; <span class="citation">American Psychological Association (<a href="#ref-american_psychological_association_ethical_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>], the very first chapter of the 7th Edition includes a review ethical, legal, and professional standards in publishing. Chapter 1 in the 7th Edition reviews the importance of ensuring the accuracy of scientific findings, protecting the rights and welfare of research participants, and protecting intellectual property rights. Given that most of these topics are covered elsewhere in this OER, we wanted to review only one issue, <em>protecting intellectual property rights</em>, because it addresses a sometimes sticky issue: publication credit and authorship order.</p>
<div id="authorship" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.1</span> Authorship<a href="APAstyle.html#authorship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Both the 7th Edition (section 1.21) and the APA Ethics Code (standard 8.12a) state that authorship is reserved for those who make a “substantial contribution.” The list of contributions that are <em>substantial</em> include formulating the research question, designing the research project, organizing and conducting the analysis, or interpreting the findings and result. Lesser contributions (e.g., entering data, recruiting subjects) on their own, do not garner authorship, but might warrant authorship if the potential author was involved in a number of these tasks. Once the list of authors is determined, the next task is to determine their order.</p>
<p>The 7th Edition (section 1.22) states that the general rule for determining author order is that the principal contributor appears first, with subsequent names appearing in order of decreasing contribution. There are some traditions where the principle investigator appears last. When authors play equal roles, this can be stated in the author note.</p>
<p>The Style Manual acknowledges that hierarchy has the potential to complicate the determination of authorship and its order. Relative status (e.g., department leader, tenure, promotion, student) should not determine the order of authorship. Further, given that a student’s dissertation is considered to be an independent project, it should be rare that a faculty member holds the position of first author. This can happen, though, when the dissertation is part of a collection of studies that are published together, the student uses data from from an existing research project sponsored by the faculty member, and/or the faculty member (with the students’ permission) engages in post-dissertation reanalysis/rewriting to ensure that the work is published.</p>
<p>Academia can be fiercely competitive and hurt feelings (in fact, broken relationships) over issues like authorship are common. In the preface of their book on longitudinal modeling, a beautiful story is told by Judith Singer and John Willett <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-singer_applied_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. The authors met at Harvard in 1985 when they competed for a single position but an unexpected vacancy led to them both being hired. Their colleagues expected them to be competitive. Early in their careers they decided to be intentionally collaborative. This involved never divulging who wrote what part of a paper, inviting the other when one was invited to speak/present, and never competing for opportunities. Part of their strategy was to include this statement in every jointly published work: “The order of the authors has been determined by randomization.”</p>
<p>Given that the collaboration evidenced by Singer and Willett <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-singer_applied_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> is unique, other strategies may be used. The Style Manual recommends that authors talk as soon as practical to establish the <em>process and criteria</em> for determining the author order. We have linked a <a href="https://github.com/lhbikos/TransformingResearchMethods/blob/main/Authorship%20Rubric220721.xlsx">rubrics</a> that is sometimes used in research teams to help make these decisions.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.2</span> Writing Effectively<a href="APAstyle.html#writing-effectively" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>There are a number of popular resources for writing scholarly, scientific, and empirical papers. The content of the fourth chapter of the 7th Edition provides guidelines for achieving the hallmarks of APA Style: continuity, flow, conciseness, and clarity. The topics within Chapter 4 represent suggestions for transitioning more casual writing (e.g., wordiness, anthropomorphisms, subject-verb agreement) to be more clear, precise, and efficient.</p>
<p>The last section of the 7th Edition’s fourth chapter reviews broader strategies to improve writing. We highlight two of these examples. Section 4.25 recommends the vicarious strategy of <em>reading</em>. We find it extremely valuable to find one or more articles, from a high quality journal, that is similar or parallel to what is being written or created. After reviewing the paper for content, examine it from a <em>meta</em> perspective, asking the questions that are important to you. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>At what breadth or specificity does the paper open?<br />
</li>
<li>What heading/subheadings are used? How are transitions made?</li>
<li>How are the hypotheses identified – numbered? narrated?</li>
<li>Is there a format for presenting statistical output?</li>
<li>What is presented in the text versus a table?</li>
<li>How does the paper end (e.g., summary vs. call-to-action)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The 7th Edition’s Chapter 4 also recommends creating an outline. A well-structured outline should guide a reader/reviewer through a paper, even if the content is missing. To demonstrate this point, we present the headings of our example article by Huang and Chan <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-huang_effects_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. As you examine it, note how the content of the headings and subheadings in the introduction map onto the method and results.</p>

<p>In many research methods classes, tutorials, and books on writing, trainees are instructed to write an outline. In our own program graduate students are encouraged to create a “mangy cat outline,” where “some part of the outline will have more fur (details) than others.” Writers can expect to revise, update, and restructure the outline as they work through all the steps of the research process.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, this OER’s chapter on <a href="OpSci.html#OpSci">open science</a> describes the value that preregistration of a research project can have on transparency of science. We also suggest that in lieu of (or in addition to) outlining the paper, completing a preregistration may also serve as a tool for collecting and organizing ideas that can be a starting place for drafting the journal article.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.3</span> Reducing Bias<a href="APAstyle.html#reducing-bias" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>New to the 7th Edition is the content of the fifth chapter, “Bias-Free Language Guidelines.” Accompanying this chapter is a strong message that the guidelines for bias-free <em>language</em> (note the use of <em>language</em> and not just <em>writing</em>) will be forever-evolving. We highlight a few general guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call people what they call themselves (especially in qualitative or participant-informed research designs).
<ul>
<li>Recognize that no group is monolithic; remain attentive to within-group differences. For example, There is debate about person-first language (“a child with autism”) and identity-first language (“an autistic child”).</li>
<li>Get consultation and listen to the research participants.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accept that language changes with time; remain attentive and flexible.</li>
<li>“White,” “heteronormative,” and “U.S.” is often the standard against others are judged.
<ul>
<li>When comparisons are made, placing the socially dominant group on the left side of a graph or at the top of a table may imply these groups are the universal standard.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In describing any population, provide a summary of <em>relevant</em> characteristics. It is unnecessary to collect and report all personal characteristics (particularly if they are distal to the focal topic).</li>
<li>Avoid the temptation to be passive or euphemistic. Instead, describe actual differences between the target and general populations clearly and professionally.</li>
<li>There are specific guidelines for level of specificity in labels/language for various populations (e.g., disability, age, gender identity, race/ethnicity/nationality, sexual orientation, SES). When writing about a topic or population, take time to look up the current guidelines, again.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chapter had extensive and specific guidelines for reducing bias by age, disability, gender, research participants, racial and ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and the recognition of intersectionality. In keeping with the opening theme, the guidelines continue to evolve.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-rules-of-style" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.6.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.4</span> The Rules of Style<a href="APAstyle.html#the-rules-of-style" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The sixth chapter of the 7th Edition provides the guidelines that bring uniformity to papers. Among so many other things, we learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the Oxford comma,</li>
<li>use single quotation marks only within double quotation marks,</li>
<li>use lowercase for diseases, theories, therapies, or statistical procedures, and</li>
<li>space once after punctuation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chapter also includes a helpful table that provides properly formatted statistical abbreviations and symbols. Additionally, there are detailed instruction for creating tables and figures.</p>
</div>
<div id="references-2" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.6.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.5</span> References<a href="APAstyle.html#references-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Chapters 8 through 11 of the 7th Edition address in-text citations and the reference list. These chapters are are probably most consulted in the Style Manual. What may be surprising is the broader information provided about (a) the degree to which material should be cited, (b) plagiarism, (c) self-plagiarism, and (d) choosing between paraphrases and direct quotations. In the era of open science, there is also a section addressing “which” version of any document should be cited when there are multiple versions (e.g., pre-print, online first, print version)available. <em>The answer to this question is: cite the version used.</em></p>
<p>Authors of the 7th Edition have continued to provide numerous examples and variations for users to emulate. They have also invested more time in creating a reference list entry when no match is perfect. The 7th Edition indicates that the general format of the reference is: Author (Date). Title. Source.</p>
<p>Each element of the reference entry is associated with a question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author: Who is responsible for the work?</li>
<li>Date: When was the work published?</li>
<li>Title: What is the work called?</li>
<li>Source: Where can I retrieve the work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Table 9.1 in the 7th Edition provides a chart for creating a reference when information is missing.</p>
<p>The text-citations and reference lists must be 100% consistent. If you have consistently used a reference management system (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley) and each reference entry is accurate and complete, this will happen rather magically. Even so, one of the last things we recommend is a text-cite/ref-list cross check. We open two copies of the manuscript and put them side-by-side on a computer monitor. Starting with the text (using track changes), each time we come to a reference, we put an X in front of it the reference list entry. We go through the entire document. If there are items in the reference list missing, we note and add them. If there are additional references in the reference list that we have not checked, we do a quick search to see if they are really missing, and if so, we delete them. In addition to ensuring text-cite/ref-list consistency, this type of review often reveals other issues that should be corrected prior to submission or dissemination.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.6</span> Publication<a href="APAstyle.html#publication" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The 12th chapter of the 7th Edition provides an overview of the publication process including preparing publication, understanding the editorial publication process, preparing the manuscript, and copyright and permission guidelines.</p>
<p>Especially helpful in the 12th chapter is the overview of the publication process and the descriptions of the roles of the decision-makers: the editor-in-chief, associate editors, consulting or advisory editors, and ad hoc reviewers. Also helpful is the description and options associated with the editorial adjudications: acceptance, revise-and-resubmit, and rejection.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Revisiting the Culture of APA Style<a href="APAstyle.html#revisiting-the-culture-of-apa-style" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>As a reader, you may correctly presume that if we have taken the time to review core elements of APA Style, that we must value them. We do. A manuscript or article that is organized predictably and contains the required information in the assigned places makes it much more efficient to evaluate and utilize. As the first author (Bikos), I have spent decades learning APA Style, and as Madigan <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> predicted, I have inculcated many of its values. I truly enjoy reading an article that is clear, precise, and efficient. Preparing this chapter has helped me become increasingly aware, though of the liabilities of such a narrowly prescribed way of writing.</p>
<p>Critical consciousness requires the identification and interrogation of all the systems in which we operate – especially and including those things we love. Earlier in this chapter we encouraged the reader to review Okun’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-okun_white_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> characteristics of White Supremacy Culture and to make note of places where APA Style reflects White Supremacy Culture. Below, we have added a few notes describing our observations, especially as they relate to the publication of scholarship more broadly.</p>
<p>Below we have again listed the characteristics of White Supremacy Culture. This time we have added brief descriptions when we have observed overlap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfectionism</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Perfectionistic culture</em>
<ul>
<li>The level of negotiable detail surrounding research designs, choice of statistics and interpretation, and writing up the results – combined with the culture of peer review – means that the <em>perfect study</em> is never attained. While this cautiousness offers strength in the form of humility, it may also contribute to a self-deprecation and doubt that stalls works from being completed and prevents authors from moving their scientific findings into advocacy and practice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Worship of the written word</em>
<ul>
<li>The entire Style Manual is about “the written word.” For example, of the 7th Edition’s 427 pages, 310 (73%) are devoted to citing other work. Further, abundant citation of other works is expected, especially in the Introduction, Method, and Results sections. In our own writing, we have shied away from citing personal communication, online videos, and podcasts because (a) the mechanisms for citation are less clear and (b) we fear they would be viewed as less credible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Only one right way</em>
<ul>
<li>The 7th Edition provides explicit instructions for everything from the formatting of statistical symbols to the use of commas. Many of these conventions leave no room for debate; they are either “correct” or “incorrect.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Either/or thinking</em>
<ul>
<li>We are not thinking of examples of this that we observe in APA Style. With psychology’s recognition of philosophies of science including constructivist-interpretivist and critical-ideological and attention to the way that confounds and error can be introduced into a study, we do not see this as a general characteristic of the profession or APA Style.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Concentration of power</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Power hoarding</em>
<ul>
<li>As described in the 7th Edition’s 12th chapter, the publication process is hierarchical, with decisions relying on layers of peer reviewers and decision-makers. Additionally, power is earned and retained through the requirement to locate new studies in the context of the prior literature through the citation of prior literature. In turn, citations are directly related to impact factors and, in turn, tenure, promotion, prestige, and status. Thompson’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thompson_gentlemanly_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> proposal that knowledge (i.e., scholarly products, in particular) is property, underscores this point.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Paternalism</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Defensiveness</em>
<ul>
<li>Although manuscripts and correspondence about them (i.e., cover letters, editorial feedback, revisions letters) are to be written with tones that are professional, neutral, and objective, the purpose of each is to <em>defend</em> ones’ work. With experience, scholars become quite skilled at providing compelling defenses of their work and posturing toward “acceptance” of a peer-reviewed submission.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Right to comfort</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Fear of open conflict</em>
<ul>
<li>As we noted earlier, Madigan <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> described APA Style has one that was tentative and cautious. That is, authors <em>hedge</em> with hesitant language and statements that “more confirmation is needed.” Through the use of techniques like using first person (section 4.16) and an active voice (section 4.13), the 7th Edition is promoting a more direct style of writing. That said, in the publication process, peer reviewers provide their impressions to the editor, the editor summarizes the feedback and renders a decision to the author(s). The correspondence between all parties tends to be very professional and somewhat ingratiating. Combative tones are discouraged.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Individualism</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>I’m the only one</em>
<ul>
<li>Although not necessarily communicated in the Style Manual, <em>replication</em> studies have been avoided because they fail to make a unique contribution to the literature. As described in the chapter on <a href="OpSci.html#OpSci">open science</a>, this has likely contributed to the replicability/reproducibility crisis, in that if replications failures had been observed sooner, then researchers could begin closer investigations into why.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Progress is more/bigger</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Objectivity</em>
<ul>
<li>The <em>precision</em>, <em>clarity</em>, and <em>efficiency</em> goals of APA Style are intended to provide the assurance of objectivity. Even in qualitative studies, researchers provide disclosure/transparency statements to assure the reviewers and readers that they have approached their topic in a manner that is unbiased and neutral.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Quantity over quality</em>
<ul>
<li>Common among the curriculum vita of academics is the enumeration of scholarly products so that their counts can be easily included in applications for promotion and tenure. Additionally, many institutions require additional data about the impact that faculty work has had; the most common being “times cited” as well as the impact factor of the journal. This latter criteria, though, is a reflection of quality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Sense of urgency</em>
<ul>
<li>Historically, the publication process has been quite slow. With competition, though, from open access journals (where the time from submission to publication can be a matter of days or weeks), we have observed top tier journals shortening the timeframe that volunteer peer reviewers are given to review and submit their reviews. We have also noted that some journals will offer “online first” access to publications and permit researchers to post preprints to institutional repositories and their own social media (e.g., ResearchGate).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, our review suggests that APA Style incorporates characteristics of White Supremacy Culture. Subsequently, we might ask, “How do these serve to maintain the power structures within psychology (or academia, or scholarship)?” Although we expect there are many contexts in which APA Style facilitates the location of power in the Western, White, cis-hetero, male, the global context is particularly salient to the first author (Bikos).</p>
<p>International scholars, particularly those for whom English is a foreign language, are one group that face significant challenges in publishing their research – even when the science is meritorious <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gibbons_inaugural_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Gibbons, 2012</a>)</span>. I have lived and taught internationally; co-authored papers with international colleagues; and peer-reviewed a number of manuscripts from international authors and for international journals. It is from these experiences I share first-hand observations and offer recommendations for moving forward.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, my family was living and working in Ankara, Turkey. I had finished up a manuscript and was ready to submit it for publication. At the time, submitting to a U.S. journal required that multiple copies of the paper be printed on 8.5 x 11 inch (i.e., “letter sized”) paper. The international standard is A4 (8.25 x 11.75), and my searching for letter-sized paper turned up empty-handed. Our family’s assignment in Turkey was because of my partner’s position with a multinational corporation. This privilege made it possible to have several reams of paper delivered within a couple of weeks. Given that we now submit papers online, this particular barrier no longer exists. It does, though, provide a concrete example of how barriers that have nothing to do with the rationale for the study, the quality of the research design, or the readability of the final manuscript, create inequitable barriers to participate in the process.</p>
<p>A second observation came when a Turkish colleague asked me to proofread a paper. The editorial letter my colleague received recommended that the paper be “edited by a native speaker.” The colleague was confused because the second author of the manuscript was a well-published, White, male, Counseling Psychologist, from the U.S., who had stated that the manuscript was ready for submission. After a weekend of deep editing, I (an early career professional, at the time) emerged with a feeling of disillusionment. In this circumstance, the positionality of the co-author should have facilitated the publication process for my colleague. Yet, this esteemed scholar failed to invest the time and resources (a task well within his skill set) that would benefit them both. As my career has unfolded, the exploitative relations between U.S. scholars and international collaborators (especially LMICs [low/middle income countries]) has been well documented <strong>CITATION</strong>.</p>
<p>Recognizing the significant challenges to publication, <em>International Perspectives in Psychology</em> has prioritized disseminating research from global scholars <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gibbons_inaugural_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Gibbons, 2012</a>)</span>. One response to that was an <em>editorial mentoring</em> program. Unfortunately, only three projects were completed through that program before it was deemed unsustainable <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gibbons_ippquo_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Gibbons &amp; Carr, 2016</a>)</span>. I served as an editorial mentor in this program. As one who embraces APA Style, it was deeply rewarding to assist authors translate their manuscripts to the language of the APA journal. This work, though, brought to life the notion that APA Style is much more than (a) sorting the information into the pre-defined categories, (b) editing the writing so that it is clear, precise, and efficient, (d) formatting tables and figures, (e) presenting the results in the prescribed ways, and (e) creating an APA Style reference list that is consistent with the text citations. As Madigan <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-madigan_language_1995" role="doc-biblioref">Madigan et al., 1995</a>)</span> noted, APA Style is multi-layered, including the guidelines for most aspects of writing, but also conveying values and a way of thinking.</p>
<p>The editorial mentor role contrasts with that of the gate-keeping peer reviewer. Further, the systems used for peer review make it difficult to provide the detailed copyediting feedback that I could provide. For most journals, feedback must be written on a separate document in an enumerated, line-by-line, narration. Pointing out errors of grammar/style (particularly when they are plentiful) is time consuming because each must be described. I suspect many peer reviewers “mark up” the document as they are reviewing it. Thus, using a system that allowed this document to be included in the peer review could functon to <em>teach</em> APA Style.</p>
<p>The three recommendations that emerge from these personal examples include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We must critically examine every aspect of the publication process and ask, “How does it facilitate the dissemination of good science?” If it does not, consider its removal or restructuring.</li>
<li>We must recognize that APA Style interacts with the existing power structures and can be leveraged to prevent dissemination from those who hold marginalized and minoritized identities.</li>
<li>We could examine the tools and processes we use for peer review. To that end,</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Grammar, APA style, and formatting should not prevent a project that has scientific merit from being published.</li>
<li>Given our current technologies, it could be relatively easy to allow peer reviewers (or perhaps a designated reviewer) to provide direct, copyediting feedback, to the author.</li>
</ul>
